# Michael Short
**`Software Engineer`**

I began [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend) in March, 2024 which is when I realized I wanted to pursue software development. While I had just been exposed to coding several months earlier, I didn't know which type of work I wanted to focus on. I had an absolute blast completing Boot.dev which is how I knew that back-end development would be a good fit for me. Go has been my favorite language to work in, after doing some Python and JavaScript in the past. The robust standard library, static typing, syntax, toolchain, package manager, etc. Everything is fantastic. Not to mention the mascot. I'm looking forward to transitioning careers and getting a full-time role as a junior backend developer.

  <summary><h3>ðŸ“– My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
    <p>
      My first exposure to coding was with Codecademy and later Coursera. At the time, I didn't know anything about coding. My first ventures were in data analytics (SQL, R) and front-end development. I completed an obscene amount of certificates but in the end just felt like these weren't the best fit for me. At the very least, they introduced me to some basic coding concepts and I was always excited when I could write code. One day I was watching ThePrimeagen and saw he recommended Boot.dev.

      The majority of my learning has come from Boot.dev. I love how I was forced to actually write code the entire time and the gamification was icing on the cake. The path is split into two halves, computer science and backend-specific concepts. It started off easy with some Python but quickly became significantly harder. I realized that the resources I was using previously were very superficial.

      It took me around 8 months to complete it, however, I had to go back and review concepts many times. I even re-read and completed certain projects and courses multiple times. For me, I need repeated exposure before I can grasp certain concepts, especially ones that are particularly abstract. All in all, after completing the entire pathway, reviewing, and building projects, it's nearing one year. I am so thankful for Boot.dev, as it got tiresome trying out the endless resources available online (Coursera, Codecademy, Edx, Udemy to name a few). Having an all-in-one, structured, progressive resource kept me on track and motivated the entire time. I think there will always be more to learn and review, but the next big step for me is actually making that career pivot.
