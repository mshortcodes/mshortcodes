**`Backend Developer`**

I began [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend) in March, 2024 which is when I realized I wanted to pursue backend development. While I had just been exposed to coding several months earlier, I didn't know which type of work I wanted to focus in on. On Boot.dev I enjoyed all the topics and (almost) every single course. This was how I knew backend was for me. Go has been my favorite language to work in. The robust standard library, static typing, garbage collector, syntax, toolchain, package manager, etc. Everything is fantastic. Not to mention the mascot. I'm looking to transition careers and get a full-time role as a junior backend developer.

  <summary><h3>ðŸ“– My Boot.dev Journey</h3></summary>
    <p>
      The majority of my learning has come from Boot.dev. It's by far my favorite resource after having tried some others in the past, namely Coursera and Codecademy. These felt more superficial and didn't teach me the foundational computer science concepts that Boot.dev dedicates half of its learning path to. I love how I was forced to actually write code the entire time. The game element was not necessary to me, but sort of just icing on the cake. I only cared about a quality resource that was well-structured and taught me what I needed to know without extra fluff. I knew I could trust it as a resource since ThePrimeagen recommended it and I was watching him occasionally.

      The path is split into two halves, computer science and backend-specific concepts. It started off easy with some Python which I had briefly covered before, but then quickly became significantly harder. I want to say it took me around 8 months to complete it, however I had to go back and review concepts many times. I even re-read and completed certain projects and courses multiple times. For me, I need repeated exposure before I can grasp certain concepts, especially ones that are particularly abstract. All in all, after completing the entire pathway, reviewing, and building projects, it's nearing one year. I am so thankful for Boot.dev, as it got tiresome dabbling in the endless resources available online (Coursera, Codecademy, Edx, Udemy to name a few). Having an all-in-one, vetted, progressive resource kept me on track and motivated the entire time.
